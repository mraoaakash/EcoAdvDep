# Social isolation reduces metabolic rate and social preference in Wild-type Zebrafish (Danio rerio)

### Abstract
The adaptive and maladaptive effects of social isolation in various animal models, especially under pathogen stress, have generated particular interest since the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined metabolic, social and movement outcomes induced by a month of visual and olfactory social isolation in adult wild-type zebrafish. Our primary interest was examining metabolic savings and changes in social preference, with movement reduction as a manipulation check for effective social isolation. We found that socially isolated fish demonstrated a significant decrease in metabolic rate, social preference and average speed of movement compared to the pre-intervention baseline. The reduction in metabolic rate could lead to contextually beneficial energy expenditure savings for the fish; however, the more mixed effects of reduced social preference and average speed of movement might only be helpful in environments with a high predatory threat and high food and mate abundance. This study opens up various possibilities to explore the adaptive significance of social isolation in various ecological frameworks.
